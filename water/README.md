# Sipper

We slightly modified the holder from [this project](https://hackaday.io/project/160388-automated-mouse-homecage-two-bottle-choice-test-v2). You can also find the original file [in our repo](https://github.com/matiasandina/homecage_hardware/blob/master/water/sipper_tube_holder.stl)

We added a hole for a magnet and adjusted the hook to fit our divisor. The current version is `sipper_tube_holder_v2`.
