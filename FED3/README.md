# FED3

We are using FED3 devices to feed animals and log their eating.

A copy of the files used for this project is kept in this repository. Check [FED3's Wiki](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3/wiki) for all relevant details.

We added a divisor that separates the device from mice and also allows for holding a water bottle (see [Sipper]()).
